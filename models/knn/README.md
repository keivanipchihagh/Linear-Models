# K-Nearest Neighbors

### Advantages
- No training is required.
- KNN is a suitable algorithm to be used for multiclass classification.
- KNN can constatly evolve and adapt to new data being fed into te algorithm.
- KNN has no assumptions about the data, meaning it does not require weights.
### Disadvantages
- KNN is not suitable for large datasets as it iterates throught all the data every time.
- KNN is sensitive to noises, outliers and missing data.
- KNN requires *feature scaling*, otherwise it may generate wrong predictions.
